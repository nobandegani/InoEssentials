# InoEssenials
InoEssentials is a cpp and bp set of function libraries and subsystems and content.

i created this plugin when im working on my indie game InoLab Trials, to help me for the development and make it easier for me to use bp.

have so many different tools in it, some of them is production ready and already tested in prod env in multiple games, some of them only 10% complete and not tested at all.

so before using something make sure its good and working perfectly. or u can join discord to check with me or need any assistance.
